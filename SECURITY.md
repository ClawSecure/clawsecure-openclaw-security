# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability in ClawSecure

If you've discovered a security vulnerability in the ClawSecure platform itself, we appreciate your responsible disclosure.

**Please do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

### How to Report

Email your findings to **security@clawsecure.ai** with:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- The potential impact
- Any suggested remediation

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment** within 48 hours of your report
- **Status update** within 7 days with our assessment
- **Credit** in our security acknowledgments (if desired) once the issue is resolved

### Scope

This policy covers vulnerabilities in:

- The ClawSecure web platform at [clawsecure.ai](https://www.clawsecure.ai)
- The Security Clearance API
- The Watchtower monitoring system

### Out of Scope

- Vulnerabilities in OpenClaw skills themselves — please [submit these for scanning](https://www.clawsecure.ai/#scan) or file a [Suspicious Skill Report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/skill_report.md)
- Vulnerabilities in third-party services or dependencies not maintained by ClawSecure
- Social engineering attacks against ClawSecure team members

## Reporting Vulnerable OpenClaw Skills

If you've found a security issue in an OpenClaw skill (not in ClawSecure itself):

1. **Scan the skill** at [clawsecure.ai](https://www.clawsecure.ai/#scan)
2. **File a Suspicious Skill Report** in this repository using our [issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/skill_report.md)
3. **Report to ClawHub** if the skill is actively distributed on the ClawHub marketplace

## Supported Versions

ClawSecure is a hosted platform. Security patches are deployed continuously. There are no self-hosted versions to maintain.
